## Game-Show-App

In this project, I have developed a browser version of "Wheel of Success" or else "Wheel of Fortune", a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.

###### GAME RULES 

The player Starts with 5 lives.

Each time the player guesses a letter, 50 points are added to the score count, if the letter chosen isn't in the phrase, one life is removed.

If the player finds the phrase, a winning screen will display and 1000 points are added to the score which from there can continue and guess another phrase keeping the score.

If the player runs out of lives a losing screen will display, player will see the highest score achieved and then it will reset back to 0 if wishes to play again.
